Originally developed as a study project for the [Andrzej Nagorko](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/en/employees/1860/) advanced C++ class, **miceFast** combines low-level optimizations and an object-oriented design to streamline multiple imputation workflows. 
**miceFast** is a high-performance R package designed to expedite the process of data imputation, particularly for large datasets where speed and efficiency are paramount. 

One of the most notable highlights of **miceFast** is its blazing-fast implementation of predictive mean matching (PMM). 
By leveraging presorting and binary search algorithms, **miceFast** can significantly outperform many existing solutions in R, including the well-known *mice* package. Indeed, the author’s contributions to *mice* helped enhance its underlying C-level optimizations—an achievement that now fuels the robust performance of **miceFast** itself.

**Key Features & Advantages:**

1. **Speed and Efficiency**  
   - **Presorting and Binary Search**: Achieves one of the fastest PMM procedures available in R.  
   - **Group-Based Operations**: Optimizes performance in scenarios where a dataset must be processed by grouping variables.  
   - **Single Model Evaluation**: Multiple imputations are conducted in a single model pass, eliminating redundant computations.

2. **Object-Oriented Paradigm**  
   - **Flexible API**: The `miceFast` class offers an array of methods to fill missing data using techniques such as linear regression, Bayesian approaches, and discriminant analysis.  
   - **Enhanced Readability & Modularity**: Easily integrate custom or advanced imputation strategies without sacrificing clarity.

3. **Integration with Popular R Tools**  
   - **`data.table` and `dplyr`**: Work seamlessly with major data manipulation packages in R.  
   - **Boosted BLAS Support**: Encourages Windows, Linux, and macOS users to leverage optimized BLAS libraries for potential 100x speedups.

4. **Extensive Documentation & Benchmarks**  
   - **Vignettes & Tutorials**: Learn the details of advanced usage via the comprehensive [**miceFast Intro Vignette**](https://polkas.github.io/miceFast/articles/miceFast-intro.html).  
   - **Performance Validation**: Real-world benchmarks and performance metrics are available in the `performance_validity.R` file within the `extdata` folder.

**Installation:**

```r
# From CRAN:
install.packages("miceFast")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("polkas/miceFast")
```
