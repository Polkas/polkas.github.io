## Contributions to *teal* and Family Packages

During my time at InsightsEngineering, I contributed to several projects, including:

- **teal**: A modular and dynamic framework for building Shiny applications tailored to data exploration and analysis. Its ability to streamline the creation of interactive tools for clinical and pharmaceutical data workflows made this work especially rewarding.
- **Family Packages**: A suite of complementary tools that extend **teal**’s functionality. These packages address challenges in data preprocessing, visualization, and reporting, delivering a comprehensive end-to-end solution for users.

Each project posed unique technical challenges while driving real impact in healthcare—an incredibly fulfilling combination.
