    "title": "Moving Beyond P-Values in Scientific Research: Insights from the ASA Statement and Frank Harrell",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TL;DR ASA suggests that researchers should report effect sizes, confidence intervals, and other measures of uncertainty alongside p-values.\nFor decades, p-values have been the go-to statistical tool for determining statistical significance in scientific research. However, recent criticisms of p-values have led many researchers to question their usefulness and accuracy. In response to these criticisms, the American Statistical Association (ASA) released a statement on statistical significance and p-values, calling for rethinking their role in scientific research.\nThe ASA statement highlights several limitations of p-values, including their susceptibility to misinterpretation, dependence on arbitrary thresholds, and inability to measure the strength of evidence. To supplement or replace p-values, the ASA suggests that researchers should report effect sizes, confidence intervals, and other measures of uncertainty alongside p-values.\nFrank Harrell’s blog post, “The P-Value Litany,” echoes the concerns raised by the ASA statement and calls for a move beyond p-values in scientific research. Harrell points out that p-values are affected by sample size and study design and do not provide information about effect size or the uncertainty of estimates. Instead, he suggests that researchers use confidence intervals and Bayesian statistics, which give a more complete picture of the data and are not subject to the same limitations as p-values.\nIn addition to supplementing or replacing p-values, the ASA statement and Harrell emphasize the importance of considering the clinical or practical significance of findings rather than relying solely on statistical significance. This involves evaluating effect sizes’ magnitude and relevance to real-world settings.\nIn conclusion, the ASA statement and Harrell’s blog post offer essential insights into the limitations of p-values and the need for a more nuanced approach to statistical significance in scientific research. By embracing more comprehensive statistical methods and focusing on the clinical relevance of findings, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of their research and ultimately contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.\nReference:\n\nASA p-value statement\nHarrell’s pval-litany"

    "text": "Post\nKasa Romana is a popular lottery in Poland organized by the Amino food company. Established in the 90s, the lottery provides an opportunity to win real money by collecting a set of coupons that sum up to full hundreds up to 1000. In this blog post, we will analyze the data from the last Kasa Romana event held in 2016 using the Knapsack Algorithm in R.\nBezKanalu, a popular YouTube channel in Poland that tests products during promotions, collected precisely 1002 coupons from the last event, providing a sufficient amount of data for analysis. The main objective is to find patterns in the data and determine if the collected coupons give any chance to win real money.\nTo achieve the goal, I used the Knapsack Algorithm, a classic optimization problem that involves finding the optimal way to pack a set of items into a limited space while maximizing their total value. In this case, the “items” are the coupons, and the “limited space” is the need to have a set of coupons that sum up to full hundreds up to 1000.\nI implemented the Knapsack Algorithm in R programming environment to check if there are any combinations of coupons that enable the lottery participants to win any money. The algorithm works by iterating over all possible subsets of the coupons and selecting the one that satisfies the constraints and maximizes the total value.\nThe analysis with 1000 coupons revealed that there are is NO combinations of coupons that enable the participants to win real money in the Kasa Romana lottery.\nIn conclusion, the Knapsack Algorithm is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems like the Kasa Romana lottery. By using R programming environment, I was able to analyze the data and provide valuable insights into the lottery’s patterns and trends."

    "section": "",
    "text": "TL;DR Git remains a staple in the programming community and is likely to continue being so for a long time.\nGit is a powerful technology that has revolutionized the way developers collaborate and manage their code. While newer technologies emerge every year, Git remains a staple in the programming community and is likely to continue being so for a long time. In this blog post, we will discuss why Git is here to stay and provide useful links to learn Git.\nGit is a distributed version control system that allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and maintain a history of all modifications made to the codebase. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including branching, merging, and reverting, making it an indispensable tool for developers working on complex projects.\nOne of the reasons why Git is so popular is that it is incredibly versatile and can be used for projects of any size and complexity. It also integrates seamlessly with other technologies, such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, making it an essential component of modern software development practices.\nAnother reason why Git is here to stay is that it is widely adopted across industries and companies. Many programming job offers require knowledge of Git, making it a valuable skill to have in your arsenal. According to a recent survey, over 90% of developers use Git in their work, and this number is expected to grow in the future.\nTo learn Git, there are many resources available online. GitHub provides an excellent platform for learning Git, as it offers a comprehensive guide to Git basics, as well as advanced features. Other useful resources include the official Git documentation, which provides an in-depth explanation of Git’s functionalities, and various online courses and tutorials, such as the ones offered by Udemy, Coursera, and Codecademy.\nIt’s worth noting that GitHub or other repositories are not Git, but rather extensions of it. Git can be used without these platforms, and there are many alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.\nIn conclusion, Git is a powerful technology that has transformed the way developers collaborate and manage their code. It is widely adopted and offers a wide range of functionalities, making it an indispensable tool in modern software development practices. Learning Git is essential for developers who want to stay competitive in the job market, and there are many resources available online to help you get started."
