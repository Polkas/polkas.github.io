TL;DR Git remains a staple in the programming community and is likely to continue being so for a long time.

Git is a powerful technology that has revolutionized the way developers collaborate and manage their code. While newer technologies emerge every year, Git remains a staple in the programming community and is likely to continue being so for a long time. In this blog post, we will discuss why Git is here to stay and provide useful links to learn Git.

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and maintain a history of all modifications made to the codebase. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including branching, merging, and reverting, making it an indispensable tool for developers working on complex projects.

One of the reasons why Git is so popular is that it is incredibly versatile and can be used for projects of any size and complexity. It also integrates seamlessly with other technologies, such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, making it an essential component of modern software development practices.

Another reason why Git is here to stay is that it is widely adopted across industries and companies. Many programming job offers require knowledge of Git, making it a valuable skill to have in your arsenal. [According to a recent survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/09/beyond-git-the-other-version-control-systems-developers-use/), over 90% of developers use Git in their work, and this number is expected to grow in the future.

To learn Git, there are many resources available online. GitHub provides an excellent platform for learning Git, as it offers a comprehensive guide to Git basics, as well as advanced features. Other useful resources include the official Git documentation, which provides an in-depth explanation of Git's functionalities, and various online courses and tutorials, such as the ones offered by Udemy, Coursera, and Codecademy.

It's worth noting that GitHub or other repositories are not Git, but rather extensions of it. Git can be used without these platforms, and there are many alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

In conclusion, Git is a powerful technology that has transformed the way developers collaborate and manage their code. It is widely adopted and offers a wide range of functionalities, making it an indispensable tool in modern software development practices. Learning Git is essential for developers who want to stay competitive in the job market, and there are many resources available online to help you get started.
