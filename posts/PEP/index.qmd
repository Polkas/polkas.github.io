TL;DR Python Enhancement Proposals (**PEPs**) are the official mechanisms for proposing, discussing, and implementing new features or changes in the Python programming language. They play a pivotal role in Python's evolution, ensuring that enhancements are thoughtfully considered and standardized. From defining coding style guidelines like **PEP 8** to introducing major language features, PEPs provide a structured pathway for Python's continuous improvement. Understanding PEPs is essential for developers who wish to contribute to Python's growth, stay informed about upcoming changes, or simply adhere to best practices in their Python projects.

## Introduction to PEPs

In the dynamic world of software development, programming languages must evolve to meet the ever-changing needs of developers and the technological landscape. **Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)** serve as the official channel through which Python's evolution is managed. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEPs are essential for maintaining the coherence, consistency, and quality of Python as it grows and adapts.

## What Are PEPs?

**Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)** are formal documents that outline new features, improvements, or processes for the Python programming language. They are authored by members of the Python community, including core developers and other contributors, and are intended to provide a clear and structured method for proposing significant changes to Python.

### Key Characteristics of PEPs

- **Formal Process**: PEPs follow a structured format and review process to ensure that proposed changes are thoroughly vetted.
- **Community-Driven**: They are open to contributions from the entire Python community, fostering collaborative development.
- **Documentation**: PEPs serve as historical records of Python's evolution, documenting the rationale behind major decisions and features.

## The PEP Process

The PEP process is a well-defined pathway that ensures proposed changes are carefully considered and standardized before being integrated into Python. Here's an overview of how the PEP process works:

1. **Idea Conception**: A developer identifies a need or improvement for Python and formulates an initial idea.
2. **Drafting the PEP**: The proposer writes a detailed PEP, adhering to the [PEP 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) guidelines, which cover the purpose, scope, and structure of PEPs.
3. **Submission and Review**: The PEP is submitted to the Python community, where it undergoes discussion and feedback from other developers.
4. **Approval**: For a PEP to be accepted, it must receive approval from the Python Steering Council or relevant authority, depending on its nature.
5. **Implementation**: Once approved, the proposed changes are implemented in Python, often accompanied by updates to documentation and tooling.
6. **Finalization**: The PEP is updated to reflect its final status and integrated into Python's official documentation.

## Notable PEPs That Shaped Python

Several PEPs have had a profound impact on Python, introducing pivotal features and guidelines that developers rely on today.

### PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code

Perhaps the most well-known PEP, **PEP 8**, provides comprehensive guidelines on writing clean and readable Python code. It covers aspects like indentation, naming conventions, line length, and more, promoting consistency across Python projects.

```{pyodide-python}
# Example of PEP 8 compliant code
def calculate_area(radius):
    """Calculate the area of a circle given its radius."""
    import math
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative.")
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
```

### PEP 20: The Zen of Python

**PEP 20**, known as the "Zen of Python," encapsulates Python's philosophy through a collection of guiding principles. These aphorisms emphasize simplicity, readability, and explicitness.

```{pyodide-python}
import this
```

### PEP 484: Type Hints

Introduced in **PEP 484**, type hints add optional static typing to Python, enhancing code clarity and enabling better tooling support.

```{pyodide-python}
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### PEP 572: Assignment Expressions

**PEP 572** introduced the "walrus operator" (`:=`), allowing assignment within expressions, which can lead to more concise and readable code.

```{pyodide-python}
a = list(range(11))
# Without assignment expression
n = len(a)
if n > 10:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements)")

# With assignment expression
if (n := len(a)) > 10:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements)")
```

# PEP 621: Storing Project Metadata in pyproject.toml

PEP 621 specifies how to write a projectâ€™s core metadata in a pyproject.toml file for packaging-related tools to consume. This PEP aims to encourage users to specify core metadata statically for speed, ease of specification, unambiguity, and deterministic consumption by build back-ends. It provides a tool-agnostic way of specifying metadata, making it easier for users to transition between different build back-ends.

Example `pyproject.toml`:

```pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "cat2cat"
authors = [
  {name = "Maciej Nasinski", email = "nasinski.maciej@gmail.com"},
]
description = "Unifying an inconsistently coded categorical variable in a panel/longtitudal dataset."
readme = "README.md"
version = "0.1.6"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
keywords = ["panel", "categorical", "longtitudal", "inconsistent", "cat2cat"]
license = {text = "Apache License 2.0 | file LICENSE"}
classifiers = [
"Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
"Programming Language :: Python",
"Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
"Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy",
]
dependencies = [
  "numpy",
  "pandas",
  "scikit-learn",
  "importlib-resources"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
test = ["pytest", "pytest-cov", "mypy"]
docs = [
  "Sphinx", 
  "myst-parser",
  "sphinx-autoapi", 
  "sphinx-rtd-theme"
]
build = ["build"]
benchmark = ["snakeviz"]
styler = ["flake8", "black"]
all = ["cat2cat[test,docs,build,benchmark,styler]"]

[project.urls]
homepage = "https://github.com/Polkas/py-cat2cat"
documentation = "https://py-cat2cat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
repository = "https://github.com/Polkas/py-cat2cat"
changelog = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Polkas/py-cat2cat/main/CHANGELOG.md"

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]

[tool.setuptools.package-data]
"cat2cat.data" = ["*"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.8"
disallow_untyped_defs = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
```
