TL;DR Graph databases have reached a significant milestone with the publication of the Graph Query Language (GQL) as an ISO standard. 
This development marks a new era in the standardization and usability of graph databases, providing a unified query language that enhances the way we interact with graph data.
First database query language to be certified since SQL in 1987.

## The Journey to GQL

The journey to establish GQL as a standard began in September 2019 and culminated in March 2024 with the unanimous approval of the Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) ballot. 
This milestone signifies GQL's official status as an ISO standard, placing it alongside SQL in the world of database query languages.

## What is GQL?

GQL (Graph Query Language) is designed to be the standard query language for graph databases. It aims to unify various graph query languages, drawing significant inspiration from existing languages like Cypher. GQL provides a declarative syntax that allows users to describe what data to retrieve rather than how to retrieve it, similar to SQL but optimized for graph data.

## Key Features of GQL

- Declarative Syntax: GQL uses a declarative approach, making it easier for users to express complex queries.
- Flexibility: It is designed to work with various types of graph databases, including property graphs and RDF graphs.
- Interoperability: GQL promotes interoperability between different graph database systems, reducing fragmentation in the graph database landscape.

## Impact on Existing Technologies

GQL's introduction significantly impacts existing graph query languages, particularly Cypher. Neo4j, a leading graph database platform, has committed to evolving Cypher to be fully compliant with GQL. This means:

- Compatibility: Existing Cypher queries will continue to work, ensuring a smooth transition for users.
- Enhancements: GQL incorporates improvements and enhancements over Cypher, making it more powerful and aligning it closely with SQL standards.

## Why GQL Matters

GQL addresses the fragmentation in the graph database query language landscape by providing a unified standard. This unification simplifies the learning curve for new users and promotes broader adoption of graph databases across various industries. The standardization also ensures long-term viability and support for graph database technologies.

## The Future of Graph Databases with GQL

The publication of GQL as an ISO standard is expected to drive broader adoption and innovation in the graph database field. By providing a standardized and powerful query language, GQL enables more efficient and effective use of graph databases, fostering advancements in data management and analysis.

## Conclusion

The introduction of GQL marks a significant advancement in the world of graph databases. As an ISO standard, GQL provides a unified and powerful query language that enhances interoperability and usability. With the support of leading graph database platforms like Neo4j, GQL is set to transform how we interact with graph data, driving innovation and efficiency in data management.
